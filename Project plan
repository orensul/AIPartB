		So the time we will invest in this assignment will be aprox. even.

	-	We plan to practice together the algorithms from lectures like minimax, a-b pruning, 	
		machine learning, before we start to write the code of action method.

	-   we plan to do research together for deciding the best strategy for our AI player.

	-   We plan to commit changes on github repository on regular basis.

	- 	We will try to evenly distribute the handling of failures or bugs during development
		in between in person session.

		In addition we will be available to chat\talk every day.
